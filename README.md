- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Basavaraj M. Hubli, call sign - Bash
- ðŸ”§ I specialize in Virtual Prototyping and hardware modeling
- ðŸŽ® Off the clock, I build games in Godot - where logic meets creativity
- ðŸŽ¨ I also enjoy crafting 2D and 3D art, experimenting with visuals that bring ideas to life, whether in a game or a prototype

All in all, I like to do both ends of the spectrum - Tech and Art!
